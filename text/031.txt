It isn't that any of these behaviours on their own signal a threat. As shown here, you can see multiple samples that exceed the typical threshholds that are not flagged as anomalous. In the same way that you can't accurately predict housing prices based on a single metric, you can't predict threats on a single metric. You must look and evaluate the sample across all dimensions simultaneously.
